      'question':
          'What is the difference between optimistic and pessimistic locking?',
      'answer':
          'Optimistic locking assumes minimal conflict and checks before committing. Pessimistic locking prevents access by locking records.',
    },
    {
      'question': 'How do you handle high concurrency in a distributed system?',
      'answer':
          'Use techniques like load balancing, caching, eventual consistency, message queues, and distributed locks.',

      'question': 'What is the significance of Big-O notation?',
      'answer':
          'Big-O describes the performance or complexity of an algorithm as input size grows, helping evaluate time and space efficiency.',

          'How would you detect and resolve memory leaks in an Android app?',
      'answer':

      'question': 'How does GraphQL differ from REST?',
      'answer':
          'GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching, unlike REST\'s fixed endpoints.',
    },
    {
      'question': 'What are some key design principles of React?',
      'answer':
          'React is built on component-based architecture, unidirectional data flow, virtual DOM, and declarative UI.',
    },
    {
      'question': 'What is sharding and how does it improve scalability?',
      'answer':
          'Sharding splits large databases into smaller parts (shards), improving read/write performance and horizontal scalability.',
    },
    {
      'question': 'Describe Metaâ€™s approach to privacy by design.',

          'Privacy by design integrates privacy at every development stage, ensuring data minimization, transparency, and control for users.',
    },
    {
      'question': 'How do you ensure fault tolerance in a system?',
      'answer':
          'Implement redundancy, graceful degradation, retries, monitoring, backups, and fallback strategies.',
    },
    {
      'question': 'What is A/B testing and how does Meta use it?',
      'answer':
          'A/B testing compares two versions of a feature to determine which performs better, helping Meta make data-driven product decisions.',
    },
    {
      'question': 'What is eventual consistency in distributed systems?',
      'answer':
          'It means data updates will propagate to all nodes eventually, allowing temporary inconsistencies but ensuring final consistency.',

      'question': 'How do you prevent XSS attacks in web applications?',

          'Sanitize user input, use Content Security Policy (CSP), escape output, and avoid inline JavaScript.',
